# Bookings and Reservations

This is the repository for my bookings and reservation project, created following a udemy tutorial
plus a little extra magic of my own.

- Built using go v 1.23
- Uses [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/v5)
- use [alex edwards SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2) Session management
- uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)

Thanks to Trevor Sawler and his course on udemy on golang modern websites, for the lessons and inspiration.
